# ArcGisMap

The WebView Branch contains the code for map integration using the provided link and the apk is in the APKs folder in the main branch.

The ArcGisRuntime Branch contains the code for map integration using ArcGisRuntime library --> As i couldn't find any provided api key/access token i made an app that has a default token (my arc gis account map) and also accepts custom tokens aswell. It's apk is larger than github's limit so i've not included it in the repository and you can download the apk from the following link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHl9-YWUnbC1X142BBGGDiKY_tfhQdrC/view?usp=sharing.
