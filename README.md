# ArcGisMap

The WebView Branch contains the code for map integration using the provided link.

The ArcGisRuntime Branch contains the code for map integration using ArcGisRuntime library --> As i couldn't find any provided api key/access token i made an app that has a default token (my arc gis account map) and also accepts custom tokens aswell. It's apk is larger than github's limit so i've not included it in the repository but the working code is in the branch.
